# Lista de compras - React Native App (Expo)

Welcome to **Lista de compras**, a mobile application developed in React Native using the Expo platform. This app allows users to create, edit, and delete shopping lists, making their supermarket shopping experiences more organized. It contains a selection of around 560 products, each with a name and photo, extracted from a virtual supermarket.

## Key Features

- Create new shopping lists.
- Add products to your list by selecting them from an extensive range of available products.
- Edit list items, including quantity and details.
- Mark products as purchased or remove them from the list.
- Delete shopping lists that are no longer needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the Expo environment set up. If not, you can follow the instructions in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) to set up your development environment.
